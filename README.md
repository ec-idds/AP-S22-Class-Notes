# Instructions
This is also a lesson in git workflow while working with a team. 

Getting Started: 

1. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) on github. The fork button is ↗️ on the [github page.](https://github.com/ec-idds/AP-S22-Class-Notes)
2. You could do your edits right in the github web interface, and that's probably easier. So let's focus on that for now. <!--You can also "clone" it to your computer and work on it in a text editor. So this step is, optionally, [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) your fork your computer. -->

Workflow:

1. Make sure your working copy has the latest updates from my "upstream" original repo. This is done with **Fetch upstream** button on the GitHub website. 
2. Edit the README.md file to add/fix notes. (This file!) You can also add image files and link them in to the README, like screenshots. 
	* The formatting "language" of the file is Markdown. Here's how to use it: <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>
	* While looking at the README file on the website, click the **Edit** button. It also has a preview feature!
3. Commit your changes. This adds them to git. 
	* [Working in Github website](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world#making-and-committing-changes)
4. Make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world#opening-a-pull-request) to submit your work back to me to merge into the "main" copy. 

Don't worry about the Table of Contents- I'll update that when I merge your changes! Also don't merge it yourself, let me do that. 


# Session 1 - January 20
* Programming Paradigms 
* Paradigm- categories/ classes of language features that define how a language is organizes and what it can do 
* In intro to programming you were taught one paradigm of 'imperative programming' which includes global state variables, and explicit sequence of commands that update state. 
* Paradigms often overlap ex. all languages have the ability to make variables 
* JavaScript is a 'multiparadigm' language, so any paradigm style is appropriate 
* Well known paradigms 
* Functional (applicative) programming 
	* Functions are a 'first class' data type 
	* When determining if the code is functional, ask yourself can a function be assigned to a variable? If yes, then it is functional code. 
	* Languages that are functional: JavaScript, Python (limited), Scheme, Lisp, Haskell 
	* Languages that are NOT functional: C, C++, Java
* Object Oriented (OO)
	* Organizes code into objects, uses instances 
	* Instance- is what actually runs, contains real data and can run functions 
	* Can make many different instances, and each separate instance will have the same structure, but are unique and can have different data.
	* Classes can have a structure of its parent class, but is a new class, and can inherit other things  
	* Maintains a strict organization, slower to write 
* Functional programming is faster to make a product 
* Object Oriented is harder to break, used for bigger problems 
* Organized Languages 
	* Compiled and dynamic: pretty much doesn't exist, compiled programs are pre-optimized and cannot change dynamically 
	* Interpretted and dynamic: JavaScript, Ada, Small Talk, Lisp, Scheme, Scratch 
	* Compiled and static: 'bread and butter' C, C++, Rust, OO
	* Interpretted and static: 'possibly rare' if you are already using an interpreter might as well go dynamic for more power
* Speed of different languages 
	* FAST (hard to write): Assembly, C, C++ 
	* AVERAGE: Java, Python
	* SLOW (easy to write): JavaScript (code running other code)
* Golden Rule
	* As programmers we want to write our code in the easiest language possible, until we need to make it faster.  

# Session 2 - January 25

Going over chapters 1 and 2, and took a bit of a side quest into the history of computing development. 
These notes are the highlights, focusing on what is new information beyond what we learned in Intro Programming.

## Chapter 1 - Values

* Numbers
	* Always 64-bit in JavaScript. Either *integer* or *floating point* format. 
	* Integer math is always precise. Floating point is always an approximation. 
* Strings
	* Both single and double quotes can delineate strings. This is useful if you want the quote character IN your string without ending it prematurely.
	* New thing: template strings!
		* Use backticks (lowercase ~)
		* allows expressions to be evaluated, and their return value be inserted into the string
		* `${}` inserts an expression to evaluate
* Special Values
	* Nothing: `null` and `undefined` (they mean the same, no value, but come from different mechanisms)
	* Not a Number, `NaN` - technically a number type, but usually returned to indicate an error
	* `Infinity` and `-Infinity`
* `typeof x` is a unary operator that returns what type the value of x is. 

## Chapter 2 - Program Structure

* Some History of Programming
	* Grace Hopper
		* Videos on Grace Hopper 
		* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA33wW5LaNY4
		* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LR6NPpFxw4
		* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg82iV-L8ZY
	* Ada Lovelace
		* Charles Babbage
	* Grace Hopper's literal "bug"
	* Alan Turing
* structure 
	* bindings - giving a name to a value 
	* let, var, const (binding operators) 
	* sub expressions -> decided value -> bound 
	* binds variable to result of the expression 
* garbage collector will come and clean up things (data) that are no longer being used
	* imperative to functional programming 
	* garbage collector makes things dynamic, so you do not need to be deleting things yourself 
* environment 
	* collection of bindings 
	* all functions that can be run
	* all different values that can be bound to that data
	* defines how we organize the code 
* functions 
	* defined with function as a keyword, it can be called, and applied/ invoked (defined and applied) 
	* console.long = print()
* every expression returns a value
* if nothing is returned, it returns undefined 
* side effect- anything a function does that is not reflected in the output 
* control flow
	* 1. rules are intuitive 
	* 2. largely universal 
	* "if" is a big control tool 
	* keyword "break" breaks you out of a "for" loop 
* Starship Troopers by Robert A Hynlind 
# Session 3 - January 27

We went over some of chapter 3 and worked on environment diagrams

## Chapter 3 - Functions 

* Functions 
	* expressions you can apply to a set of inputs 
	* maps the input to the correct output
	* `const` and `let` are used to bind to the block they are declared in 
	* a function doesn't always apply a name or binding to something, it can or does not need to
		* this returns the return value by skipping the name
	* functions are a value type 
	* when the function is the first word used on a new line it gets hoisted to the top of the list and it becomes a global function
	* the `=` allows for you to have all the control of where the function is, if you don't use the `=` then it gets moved to the top 

* Environment diagrams or memory diagrams 
	* when you make a binding it re-assigna the value as the old one gets deleted  
	* everything without an arrow back to the global will get deleted 

# Session 4 - February 1 
## Chapter 3 Cont. 
* Arrow function 
	* "=>" fat arrow, operator, syntax choice 
	* Used to point at the body of that function, applies body to the arguments of a function 
	* Allows for one off functions very quickly 
	* Can get rid of "return" in the body if there is only one body parameter 
* Call Stack 
	* When you call a function, it goes somewhere else to execute the function, and then it comes back to "return" a value of the function 
	* "Return" returning from previous contex 
	* Call stack is a piece of data in memory that keeps track of all the ins-and-outs 
	* Goal is to keep empyting 
	* Functions compile on top of each other until they are returned, and then the program will revert back to the beginning 
	* Control of the function can only be in one place at a time 
	* Some languages do not have callback, they go to the function and can never leave 
	* Callstack = breadcrumbs 
	* There is only one call stack 
	* The call stack will do one thing at a time, but marks where in the code it was as the code jumps around to execute the code, it keeps order 
* Call Stack Tiny People Analogy 
	* In a function, a tiny person comes out and takes the arguments of the function and places the arguments in their pockets 
	* The tiny person then goes and uses the arguments to exchange for the value of the function 
	* The same tiny person then hands the value from the functions back to the original tiny person that gave them the arguments 
	* This act of returning the value is important so then the other code can resume
* Recursion 
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZcO_jRhvxs
	* recursion is another way to do repetition 
	* looping is one way to do repetition 
	* thus recursion is another way to do looping 
	* the recursion part of a function is often hidden within another function 
	* In a recursion function, you can add in another function to create a hardwired start property/ value 
	* Groundhog Day metaphor
	* You change the arguments to have the most updated information for next time it runs 
	* the callstack tracks state 
* Functional Programming 
	* first type of programming designed in the 60s
	*  It evolved a lot sooner, was mathematically pure 
	*  then computers evolved the first time, and FP became obsolete 
	*  Once computers evolved again and became astronomically better, FP came back intro fruition 
* Two main properties/ pillars of FP 
	* 1.) Can stop somewhere in the code and resume it later 
	* 2.) Stay away from state variables, as FP is looking to reduce the mess they cause 
* Making change example for recursion 
	* If you start out with different coins, to make one dollar, the combination of change will vary 
	* This represents recursion, as different decisions are being made, and all of them play out to solution 
* Recursion is seen in GPS systems and classical AI trainings 


# Session 5 - February 3

# Session 6 - February 8
## Chapter 4 - Mutability 
* every value is mutable 
* mutable = changeable, maluable, moveable 
* relies on the concept of change through making an entire new one (new binding) and throwing away the other one 
* Two things can happen to the "old" item 
	* 1.) something else points at it or not 
	* 2.) if not pointed at, the garbage collector will take it away 
* In javaScript you never explicitely delete anything 
* computers are not inherently mutable 
* mutable data is messy and unpredictable 
* immutable data is what it is, and if you need a new one, you make it 
* over time no piece of data will ever change, because it cannot change 
* you can change bindings, but the actual data never changes 
* objects actually do change, because they have a lot of things within them 
* functions- pay attention to code terms 
* objects - pay attention to data terms 
* Closure: you create a function with data already in it (makeMultiplier example) 
	* closure ensures that you do not fall into changing numbers that you did not mean to change 
* Parallelism 
	* needed so FP can come back 
	* when you have parallelism, JS is always in one place, only doing one thing at a time 
	* ex. "Google Search" works across mutliple computers 
* Why FP works well with parallel systems 
	* 1.) immutable data: it tracks your changes across machines 
	* 2.) no global state, each machine is its own "global" state, and the variables do not maintain the same in each "global" system 
* state variables are very messy 
* communication between nodes is the hardest part 
* parallelization is useful in hardware failure and if you need to reboot/ update a node 
* node: a server/ computer 

Closures demonstration code:
```JavaScript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  
  
  let makeMultiplier = function (n) {
    return function (b) {
      return b * n;
    }
  }
  
  let tripler = makeMultiplier(3);
  
  print(tripler(2));
  print(tripler(5));
  
  let quad = makeMultiplier(4);
  
  print(quad(2));
}
```

# Session 7 - February 10 
* Arrays: reduce, map, filter 
* reduce (higher order procedure): to accumulate all of the items in an array together
	* syntax: array name . reduce((total, num), start value)
* higher order function 
	* function that has to operate on other functions 
	* requires a function to be passed into it 
	* functions that talk to other functions 
	* functions are first class in JS, but not in all languages 
* MAP: makes a new array after applying opertions to the original array's values to form a new array 
	* puts the value in the original array at any time, and returns that value in its new array 
	* syntax: original array name. map((x) => whatever you want to do to the value) 
* Filter: akin to map, as it makes a new array but only includes some elements 
	* needs to test to decide whether to keep or ignore, makes things into a boolean 
	* syntax: array name . filter((x) => parameters of what variables you want included) 
* When reduce, map, and filter are used altogether, they help multiple things happen at once 
# Session 8 - February 15
* practiced reduce, map, and filter on codio 
# Session 9 - February 17 
* Objects 
	* overloaded words- multi definition, similar in vibe, mechanically different 
	* multiparadigm = multiple definitions 
	* entirely abstract, anything can be object a thing 
* Object oriented programming - way to divide program into objects, ways to organize programs as you develop them 
	* program is now a collect of objects that can talk to each other 
	* an individual object is responsible for its own code and its own parameters 
	* state variables should only be acquired to their objects 
	* objects have an internal state and internal code 
	* you can only access the states of code through reaching through accessories 
	* can create modules that work as interfaces 
	* responsible for managing its own state 
	* objects like reusable pieces 
	* the program can be local to the object and when outside that object you don't care how it works within the object 
* method, procedure, and function 
	* method: gets its content from the object it belongs to 
	* function in JS: technically a procedure - gets context from environment 
* Public vs. Private
	* 1. public- interfaces you can see outside of the object (what is on the menu)
	* 2. private- not accessible from outside, internal use only (what is behind the bar) 
* accessors: functions used to access private parts of the object 
	* JS cannot distinguish between the two 
	* used as a convention (ex. camelCase), as something used for humans to communicate, is an addition away from what the code does vs. actually means 
	* convention in JS/python= if something is an object you can name it with an underscore __ to make symbolize it is private 
	* if you accidently access it publicly, it will mess with the state, and the state will go inconsistent (BAD) 
	* in order to not have the state go inconsistent, you must USE ACCESSOR functions 
* objects oriented protects your state 
	* less severe, because you still feel consequences of direct mutation 
	* not actually changing, object changes it to maintain state, protects data from being 1/2 way processed when called 
* enforcing private vs private is based on honor system 
* methods: projects that hold function values 
* objects syntax: properties
	* object  
	* propertyName: propertyValue, 
	* propertyTwo: value2, 
* objects have their own little frame, and bindings to values 
* if you assign soemthing that doesn't exist, JS will make it exist in the object, making it easy to grow an object through many stages 
* ${line} only works with `` back tics, making it easy to change what a string says in the code 
* "this." refers to the object you are IN, how you get to properties of the object you are in 
	* when you are in an object, you do not necessarily know what it is named 
	* objects like functions don't necessarily have names 
	* it also does not know its name as it can change 
	* using this. is safer, as there is less searching in the environment, as the computer will never look for a new "this" 
	* => will use the bindings of wherever you already are 
	* every function in JS has a ".call", if you want to call that function with a different this. or in a different environment 
	* => adds this. to the frame its already in, how it is mechanically different from function 
* NOTES FOR FUTURE CLASS: skip speak.call* - just confusing, skip prototypes 
# Session 10 - March 1
* Object Oriented Classes and Inheritance 
	* objects: a way to modularize code/ programs/ state 
	* changes data as the program runs 
	* objects are stateful, hold data, that data can change is is mutable 
	* still not mutable globals 
	* code in the form of "methods"
	* obj.method() = method is a function that lives within that object 
	* class: template of a specific kind of object 
	* Instantiate: to make an instance of, an individual copy of a thing, using the blueprint for that object 
* Object syntax blueprint 
	* object classes are capitalized 
	* class of a car: 
		* var name 
		* var year 
		* var make 
		* Method: startCar 
		* Method: stopCar 
	* All objects within this class will have the above listed properties 
* Instantiation: creates space in active memory for all stuff described in the class
* A class is not an object, it is a template to create objects 
* to define a class you need to have a function called "constructor ()" 
* Constructor()
	* is where you give it the data to put into its stuff 
	* keyword "new" = instantiates a class into an object 
	* class constructors MUST be invoked within "new" 
	* with the class defined, making new ones is easy 
	* more organized and controlled way to make objects 
* Can get at things within an object using .dot operator 
* only thing you can put in the classes are methods 
* EX. 
	* let car = variable 
	* class Car = class 
	* let myCar = new Car('fiat', 2018) 
	* new constructs a new object that the function is owed to
	* "myCar" is in the global frame 
	* "fiat", "2018", and "Date" are placed within the object frame
	* "name: fiat", "year: 2018", "this.name: name" are made in the constructor frame, which will be disposed of by the garbage collector 
	* newDate() = instance when new operator is called 
	* adding stuff to this argument that was not initially an argument  
# Session 11 - March 15
* Abstraction 
	* Allow you to organize things, let you build things off of them 
	* encapsulation: objects, code/data = one unit 
	* encapsulation allows for "encryption" within an object 
	* programming language then evolved from pure extraction to including checks and balances 
	* the rules of programming are arbitrary, the rules will work if you stick to them
	* coding rules are arbitrary but when you follow them it maintains order and functionality 
* Objects 
	* Inheritance: when you have a class, and you want to change it to be more specific to a purpose and create a subclass 
	* A subclass has everything the parent class has (functions, methods, data templates) 
	* classes are used to derive other classes 
	* with subclasses you can change things in them without changing things within the parent class 
	* this concept ^ allows you to create NEW objects with all the features of the parent classes and previous subclasses 
	* classes are used a lot in GUIs 
	* classes allow you to not have to reinvent the wheel each time, different purpose similar structure 
	* classes allow you to maintain compatible features (ex. draw) 
	* can go the opposite way too and provide a more generic template to build off of 
* Jitterbug 
	* change the layout from using object orientation to classes 
	* use the "New" keyword to instantiate a new bug 
	* keyword "Extends" makes a new subclass 
* Example 
	* driver bug implements jitterbug 
	* everything new you define, and everything the parent class had 
	* 1. no reiventing the wheel
	* 2. build systems and frameworks of code 
	* need things to be able to interact with other stuff 
	* provide objects that you can sub class to organize 
	* Java- forces OO, "embarrasingly" enforces it 
## PYTHON NOTES BEGIN 
# Session 12- March 22 
* Differences in syntax and structure between JavaScript and Python 
* Data types always matter, Python is more strict 
* everything in python is an object 
* there are objects of different types 
* the type of an object defines how you can interact with it 
* 2 main categories: Scalar and Non-Scalar 
* Scalar: just a value with no structure, ex. integers, floats(decimal points), scientific notation, 
* Non-Scalar: has some internal structure, strings, arrays, classes
* In JS all numbers are floats, which have rounding error 
* Basic Operators 
	* These operations are all the same + , - , * , / 
	* "//" computes integer division, but if there is a remainder then it ignores it 
	* "%" modulus, does integer division and gives the remainder 
	* "a ** b" expect a^b exponents 
	* uses "and" "or" "not" 
	* n = 5, assigns 
	* n == 5, creates a boolean operation of T/F 
	* variable bindings are the same 
* Branching 
	* syntax of an if statement: 
	* if ( x > y) 
		* block 
		* of 
		* code 
	* else 
		* other 
		* block 
		* code 
	* if x % 2 == 0
		* print('even') 
	* if x % 3 == 0
		* print('div 2') 
	* else: 
		* print ('divisible by 2 and 3') 
* In JavaScript if statements 
	* If ()
		* code
	* else If ()
		* code
	* else ()
		* code  
* if you have a bunch of different conditions to test on one thing
* In Python: "else if" is elif 
* Nesting in python 
	* one indent to two indents the further you nest 
* Function scoping
	* how to define a function 
	* uses keyword "def" 
* Example
	* def maxVal (x, y): 
		* indented body 
		* if x > y : 
			* return x
		* else: 
			* return y 
* ":" starts the body 
* "return" stops a program, to replace a value with that function via substitution 
* none is a value like true or false, which is capitilzed in python, True or False 
* Scoping 
	* files end in .py 
	* function has to be defined in order to call it 
	* comments are made with "#" 
	* when in any function, if you have "name = " it is considered to be a local variable 
	* if there is no variable locally defined, it goes to global scope to find a value 
	* if you assign a name in a function body then it is automatically a local variable 
	* closed scope doesn't really work in python, declaration is implicit 
# Session 13 - March 24 
* Strings 
	* s = ' a, b, c, d' 
	* no built in .length, need len(s) to get the length of a string 
	* s[2] results in c, you can access like an array, good for manipulation 
	* slicing: s[1:3] = bc, slices at the spaces not at the values of the indices 
	* common slicing techniques 
		* s[0] = beginning 
		* s[1] = takes first thing off 
		* s[:-2] = starts from the end and counts backwards 
		* s[1:-1] = removes beginning and last item 
* Tuples 
	* like an array but immutable 
	* example ( 2, 4, 6, 8) 
	* if you want to change it you produce a new one with the changes applied 
	* index: t[0] -> 2
	* sliced: t[ 1: -1] -> (4, 6) 
	* cannot change assignments: t[0] = 5 X CANNOT DO X as it breaks immutability 
	* tuple of one item ('a',) you need a comma to represent it as a tuple  
* New stuff with functions 
	* x, y = func() <- can return more than one thing 
	* def func():
		* return 3, 4 <- returned as a tuple 
	* x would become 3, y would become 4 
	* known as "deconstructing" or returning some kind of structure 
	* a, b ('2', "y") can be of any items 
	* helpful to use for coordinates 
* Ranges 
	* help with iterations 
* In javaScript 
	* for ( let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		* console.log (i); 
	* } 
* In python 
	* for i in range (10): 
		* print (i) 
* range(start, stop, step) 
* if you only give the range one item, it goes to default start and step of 0 and 1 
* step can be negative and it can count down 
* range returns range type, generates numbers on demand when it needs it 
* range is used in for loops as it asks for the information from range 
* range is iterable 
* an array is iterable but all the information is in it to begin with, range has no length, values in it are generated in real time
* re-entrant function or generator = range 
* sliceable and addressable cannot concat or be used in repetition 
* concatination 
	* ('a', 'b') + ('c', 'd') -> ('a','b','c','d') X not good
	* 2* ('a', 'b') -> ('a','b','a','b') X not good 
	* equals operator can compare ranges if they produce the same sequence of integers 
	* anyuwhere you use a tuple or sequence, you can use a range to generate a sequence of numbers 
* Lists 
	* mutable 
	* like javaScript array, but can be sliced 
	* [] addressed like with brackets
	* ex. [1,2,3,4] -> list, [1:3] -> slices [1] -> index of one 
	* reason to use: if you will be programmatically adding onto it 
	* most of the time lists are built incremently than literal 
# Session 14- March 31
* keywords to know 
	* "pass"- do nothing on purpose, used for empty blocks signifying an empty block for the code to pass over 
	* "input" - give it a prompt and it will prompt the user on the screen, and it will return what the user places in the input prompt 
* testing for equality 
	* how do you know two things are 1.) of equal value or 2.) the same thing? 
* Example 
	* schools --> ["emmanuel", "simmons"] 
	* north_schools --> ["MIT", "Harvard"] 
	* Boston_Schools = [schools, north_schools] 
	* Boston_2 = [["emmanuel", "simmons"], ["MIT", "Harvard"]] 
	* Boston_schools == Boston_2 ? yes, as the values are equal, making this statement true 
	* schools [0] == Boston_schools [0][0] = same value equality 
	* Boston_2[0] == Boston_schools[0] = equal value, NOT the same object 
	* id(schools[0] == id(Boston_schools[0][0] = same object check 
* if you have 2 separate objects, but they contain the same stuff, then python will return true 
* python will also check to see if the the same actual object is being pointed at, rather than merely having the same value 
* this process is needed for object orientation, when you manipulate one variable, it will change in all the other spots that the variable is in the code 
* List Comprehension 
	* DO NOT change lists that you are iterating through
	* DO NOT mutate stuff that you are using as a control 
* MAP 
	* creates a new list when you are done with it
	* easy way to build lists and make pretty code 
* Example
	* my_list = [1,2,3]
	* double_list = [ n * 2 for n in my_list] 
	* double_list == [2,4,6] 
	* [<var> for <var> in <list>] = map(print(i for i in my_list)) 
* Isinstance (filter) 
	* tells you what "type" something is 
* Example 
	* [ x for x in "list name" if (any boolean)] = picks out certain items that meet the boolean 
	* you can add " == false" on the end of the boolean to get the opposite stuff 
* filter comes before the map function 
* python lambda can only be one expression long 
	* my_list = map(lambda x: x ** 2, my_list) 
		* print(list(my_list)) 
	
# TERMS

* Arguments: values given to functions 
* Binding: creation of a variable to its value, = can be used to assign new values to a binding 
* Bits: any kind of two-value things, usually described as 1s and 0s 
* Boolean: which has just two values, true and false 
* Environment: collection of bindings and their values that exist at a given time 
* Expression: fragment of code that produces a value 
* Function: piece of program wrapped in a value, have a set of parameters and a body, which maintains the statements to execute 
* Functional Programming: (applicative) functions are "first-class" data type, passed as arguments and returned 
* JS statement: full statement, compilation of expressions 
* Null and Undefined: denote the absence of meaningful value 
* Object-Oriented Programming: all code is organized into objects 
* Operators: +, *, -, /, %, >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, &&, ||, ! 
* Overflow: end up with a number that did not fit into the given number of bits 
* Paradigm: classes of language concepts and features that usually revolve around a central philosophy, an organizational tool to understand a collection of features 
* Program: list of statments 
* Side effects: values of expressions that do not change the world 
* Unicode standard: assigns a number to virtually every character you would ever need 
* Values: chunks of bits ex. numbers, text, functions
* Variable: catches and holds values 
* Binding: creation of a variable to its value, = can be used to assign new values to a binding 
* Environment: collection of bindings and their values that exist at a given time 
* Function: piece of program wrapped in a value, have a set of parameters and a body, which maintains the statements to execute 
* Arguments: values given to functions 
PYTHON
* Floats: when you have a decimal point in the number and it can be anywhere in the number
